# VERRNN
Verification of Recurrent Neural Networks for Cognitive Tasks via Reachability Analysis

https://github.com/nnarodytska/VERRNN/blob/master/rnn_veri.pdf

# Code Structure

  * verrnn : Our methods presented in the paper
  * marabou: Running marabou on the unrolled RNN (need to have marabou and its python API compiled and installed)
  * nnv    : NNV (need to have MATLAB and the nnv toolbox installed)
  * N7_L1_r11 : the model of 7-neuron RNN under verification

# To Run the Experiments

   TODO
