# VERRNN
Verification of Recurrent Neural Networks for Cognitive Tasks via Reachability Analysis

https://github.com/nnarodytska/VERRNN/blob/master/rnn_veri.pdf

# Code Structure

  * verrnn : Our methods presented in the paper
  * marabou: Running marabou on the unrolled RNN (need to have marabou and its python API compiled and installed)
  * nnv    : NNV (need to have MATLAB and the nnv toolbox installed)
  * N7_L1_r11 : the model of 7-neuron RNN under verification

# To Run the Experiments

   Work in progress...

## Our Tool

## NNV for comparison

## Marabou for comparison

Please first have [Marabou](https://github.com/NeuralNetworkVerification/Marabou/tree/master) and its python API installed. And then go to `marabou`, run `python bmc_marabou.py`. Results will be stored at `result.log`
